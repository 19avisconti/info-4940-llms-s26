## Assessment 

| Category                            | Ugrad | Grad |
|-------------------------------------|-------|-------|
| In-class Worksheets (participation) | 15%   | 15%  |
| Take-home assignments               | 35%   | 25%  |
| In-class Exams (2)                  | 30%   | 30%  |
| Final Presentation                  | 20%   | 10%  |
| Graduate Research Project           | 0%    | 20%  |

The grading scale is numeric, with scores >= 97 A+, 93 A, 90 A-, 87 B+, etc. There is no curve. 

**You must pass each component of the course to pass the class.** A score below 63% in any of the above categories will result in an overall grade of F. 

### In-class Worksheets
To encourage attendance, participation, and engagement with material, you will complete short worksheets in class on an approximately weekly basis. They will not be announced in advance of the day that they are assigned. These worksheets are graded for *engagement*, not correctness: all work that clearly shows effort and thought will receive full credit. Worksheet solutions will be posted here.

### Take-home assignments
Assignments will alternate between individual and group-level assignments. They will have both coding and written components. 

### Generative AI Policy
You are permitted to use AI under the following conditions. 
- You may *apply* AI *to* your writing, but you may not *substitute* AI for your writing. Generating text and code can be helpful, but a key goal of this course is to build condidence in indepedently organizing, designing, and writing.
- Everything that you turn in should be text that you or your group members have typed unless otherwise specifically indicated. In other words, you may use AI tools to check, debug, or critique, but not to actually *do* any part of assignments or projects.
- **There is zero-tolerance for "AI slop".** Course staff reserve the right to identify and penalize assignments with these characteristics.
