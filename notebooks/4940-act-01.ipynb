    "**Take Note:**\n",
    "- **Log probabilities are negative values.** A high-confidence token with $P$ close to 1 will have a log probability near 0. A low-confidence token with $P$ close to 0 will have a large negative log.\n",
    "- **Log probability decreases steadily.** Since each token's log probability is added, the log probability will keep getting more negative as the sequence grows. Compare this to the probability from Task 8.\n",
    "- Even for long sequences, the numbers remain within a normal range for floating-point computation and there is **no numerical overflow**.\n",
    "- **Differences between tokens are easier to interpret.** In log space, large negative jumps indicate particularly unlikely tokens relative to the context. "

    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "In this exercise, we explored how to track a model’s confidence in generating each token of a sequence.  \n",
    "We first calculated **probabilities** by multiplying each token’s probability and saw how these values quickly became extremely small due to the multiplication of many numbers less than 1.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, we switched to **log probabilities**, which transform multiplication into addition. This not only avoids numerical underflow but also makes it easier to interpret token‑level contributions to the overall sequence likelihood.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway:**  \n",
    "> Working in log space is the standard approach in NLP for measuring sequence likelihood, because it is numerically stable and more interpretable than raw probabilities."
